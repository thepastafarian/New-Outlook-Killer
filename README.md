I reccomend adding a shortcut to the NOK.exe file to your startup folder so that it automatically runs when you start your computer. this is good incase windows decides to push an update.

Create a Shortcut for NOK.exe:
  Navigate to the folder where NOK.exe is located.
  Right-click on NOK.exe and select Create shortcut.
  A new shortcut to NOK.exe will appear in the same folder.
  
Add the Shortcut to the Startup Folder:
  Press Win + R on your keyboard to open the Run dialog.
  Type shell:startup and press Enter. This will open the Startup folder, which holds programs that run when the PC starts.
  Drag and drop the shortcut you created earlier into the Startup folder.
  Now, every time you start your computer, NOK.exe will run automatically in the background.

Verifying that NOK.exe Runs on Startup
  Restart your computer to verify that the program runs on startup.
  After logging in, check the System Tray (the hidden icons area on your taskbar) to see if the NOK icon appears.
  You can also open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) and check under the Apps section to confirm that NOK.exe is running.
